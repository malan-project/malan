## how to start
**git clone https://github.com/malan-project/malan** to copy the project to your local machine.

**docker-compose up** to run the project.

## edit project
Since the project runs on the docker container, changing the local files does not immediately affect the program.

**./rebuild.sh** to submit the files onto docker container, and

**./run.sh** to run the project again(**docker-compose up** also works)
